I'm not yours, and, baby, you're not mine
We've got something and it sure is fine
Let's take our love, one night at a time
There's one thing that we both agree
I like you, and, baby, you like me
Let's take our love, one night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time
Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good, it can't be wrong
I got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on
Tomorrow, well, that's another day
Come on, baby
Now, what do you say?
Let's take our love, one night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time
Oh, I think about you all day long
It feels so good, it can't be wrong
I got my fingers crossed that this goes on and on
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right one night at a time
All night, love all night
Practice makes perfect, gonna get it right
Gonna get it right, one night at a time
