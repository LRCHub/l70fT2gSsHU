I'm sliding me on top of you
Doing things that lovers do
But I don't belong to you
What's a girl suppose to do?

Only need one night with you
To make all our dreams come true
You could never be my man
You can be my one night stand

Boy, I know you've got a girl
And you know I've got a man
So let's both respect the game
And have a one night stand

Everybody wanna know
But they wouldn't understand
So let's keep it on the low
And have a one night stand

Well, it's about a quarter to three
And no one's lookin', it's just you and me
You know I'm down for whatever and I came to please
But it's only for this one night

Boy, I hope that you come well prepared
'Cause I want you to know that I ain't never scared
You just got to RSVP and I'll be there
But it's only for this one night

Boy, I know you've got a girl
And you know I've got a man
So let's both respect the game
And have a one night stand

Everybody wanna know
But they wouldn't understand
So let's keep it on the low
And have a one night stand

Shawty, let me know what's up with it
Won't you let a real thug hit it?
Stop playin' with these lames, ain't got no shame
The liquor is to blame

I just got to tell you this, those lips I wanna kiss
That ass I gotta grab, your shit I gotta stab
I got my baby, mama, you got your baby, daddy
We ain't got all night, lil' mama, get it right
Your shit is good and tight

I ain't 'bout them games, shawty
You know my name, shawty
Just use your brains if you know what I'm sayin'
It's a one night stand, shawty

Boy, I know you've got a girl
And you know I've got a man
So let's both respect the game
And have a one night stand

Everybody wanna know
But they wouldn't understand
So let's keep it on the low
And have a one night stand

If you know how to keep a secret
You can get it for sure
Just make sure you get enough
'Cause you can get it no more

If you know how to keep a secret
You can get it for sure
Just make sure you get enough
'Cause you can get it no more

Come and ride witcha boy, then fill with almond joy
Like I told you, I'm something like a freak
So keep the games for the middle of the week

Damn, you look so good
With your big ol' ass and your big ol' titty bittys
Red bone, fine self, 5'9
For one night, I gotta make you mine

Yeah, I know you gotta a man, shawty
And you know I got a wife, shawty
So let's strap it up, I hope the pussy's tight
'Cause we only got one night, shawty

I'm not trynna be your girlfriend
Just for a one night stand
And you can't never be my boyfriend
Just a one night stand

Boy, I know you've got a girl
And you know I've got a man
So let's both respect the game
And have a one night stand

Everybody wanna know
But they wouldn't understand
So let's keep it on the low
And have a one night stand

And you'll be my man only for one night
And I'll be your girl only for one night
And you'll be my man only for one night
And I'll be your girl only for one night
