What am I doing here
Your face is a mess
You walk back in the room
And you put on your dress
I say I'll see you soon and I
I'll give you a call
I hear the door slam and feel nothing at all

What am I doing here
I've been here for weeks
Gotta get outta of this room and go
Go clean these sheets
Why am I lying here and with what was her name
I feel nothing at all I feel no shame

It's another one night stand
Cause it makes me feel like a real man

What am I doing here
Your face is a mess
You walk by and give me room
And you put on your dress
I say I'll see you soon and I
I'll give you a call
I hear the door slam and feel nothing at all

It's another one night stand
Cause it makes me feel like a real man

What am I doing here I've been here for weeks
Gotta get outta of this room and go
Go clean these sheets
Why am I lying here
And with what was her name
I feel nothing at all I feel no shame

It's another one night stand
Cause it makes me feel like a real man
